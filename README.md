# M-Bus Backend

## Setup

First, obtain an API key for the Magic Bus backend from [the official Magic Bus Website](https://mbus.ltp.umich.edu/dev-account).

Then, define the `MBUS_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.

To install dependencies, run `npm i`

## Running the Backend

To run the backend, run `npm start`.

By default, the service runs on port 3000. To define a port for the service to run on, define an environment variable called `PORT` before running the backend.
